## What does this code do?
This code reads in research pdfs, does a dictionary based word-count of methodological categories, and plots the results. It assumes:
- There is one research article per pdf
- The first four characters of the pdf file name encode the publication year
- pdfs are grouped by journal, and stored in a journal specific directory
